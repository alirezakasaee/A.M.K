<p align="justify">Alireza is a Microwave Engineer with almost a decade of experience in both academic and industrial settings. After earning Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electronic Engineering in 2003 and 2006, respectively, he spent five years (2008-2013) as a Microwave Engineer at the highly-regarded Research Institute in Isfahan University of Technology, Iran, where he learned design and development of a vast range of microwave solid-state circuits, including power amplifiers, splitters, combiners, couplers, filters, switches, and DC bias circuits. 
<br/>
In 2013, Alireza continued his education and research as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Science and Technology Beijing in China. His thesis, entitled "Research on RF/Microwave High-Efficiency and Broadband Solid State Power Amplifier for Wireless Communications," earned him recognition as an outstanding international student upon graduation in 2017. Following his Ph.D., Alireza returned to the research institute in his home country as an Assistant Professor. 

<p align="justify">He then applied for and was awarded grants from both the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action of the European Union and Vinnova (Swedish government agency) in 2020. In September 2021, Alireza joined Uppsala University as a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow with a high-scoring (99.4/100) proposal entitled "Implementation of Best Practices in Designing Solid State Power Amplifiers for Developing New Generation PET Accelerators". Currently, Alireza conducts research on several microwave circuits in different frequency ranges between 100MHz to 12GHz, including high-power solid-state amplifiers, splitters, and combiners at the FERIA Laboratory in Uppsala, Sweden.

    <td> <p align="justify"> The Solid-state 400 kW RF power station comprises four 100-kW power amplifier racks, which are combined through a very low-loss cavity combiner to achieve an output power of 100 kW using 64 2-kW RF power amplifiers.The output line is equipped with an isolator to safeguard the station from reflection power. The input side of the station features a 1-to-64 in-phase cavity splitter that efficiently divides the signal across the amplifiers. With the provision of isolation between all amplifier units, the station is expected to function reliably.

    <td> <p align="justify"> This design aims to utilize a pull-pull transistor to achieve a compact continuous wave 2kW RF solid-state power amplifier with a signal gain of 16 dB and up to 80% drain efficiency at 352MHz, making it suitable for use in high-power RF stations. The matching network in this design is based on a strip line configuration and does not utilize a bulun, enabling the amplifier to have very high efficiency. The PA has mechanical dimensions of 90mm x 160mm x 50mm.

    <td> <br> <p align="justify"> The current design uses the same transistor as the previous one, but the innovation lies in implementing strip line transmission lines for the input and output matching networks. This results in a significantly more compact power amplifier, achieving 2kW output power, 16 dB signal gain, and up to 80% Drain efficiency. The transistor is biased in Class-C operation mode, providing high efficiency and eliminating the need for an RF DC bias circuit. However, due to its non-linear behavior, a linearizer is necessary for applications that require linearity performance. The PA has mechanical dimensions of 90mm x 160mm x 25mm. </p> </td>

    <td> <br> <p align="justify"> Various techniques and approaches exist for dividing RF signals, but for applications requiring high power, multiple medium power amplifiers must be utilized, necessitating the use of a low loss splitter. The spatial cavity splitting method is highly sought after due to its ability to not only provide low loss division but also occupy minimal space. A 1 to 64 RF spatial splitter utilizing this design has been created, which only incurs a 0.2 dB signal loss and has mechanical dimensions of 90mm x 50mm x 10mm. </p> </td>

<!--4 Cavity_Combiner************************************** -->    
  <tr> 
    <td><img src="./imgs/CavityCom2.jpg" align="left" /></td>
    <td> <br><p align="justify"> The RF signal combination process is a crucial stage in the design of high power stations, particularly for 100 kW power combiners. It is essential to minimize the incident power loss in order to prevent excessive heating, which can reduce the system efficiency. When combining 64 medium power amplifiers, a cavity combiner configuration is the optimal choice as it provides the lowest power loss. This method also requires very little space in comparison to other methods such as Binary, Wilkinson, or Gysel. The designed combiner exhibits an impressively low power loss of only 0.17 dB, which is a testament to its efficiency. Additionally, the combiner was designed with cost-effectiveness and compactness in mind at 352MHz, measuring only 90mm x 50mm x 10mm in size. </p> </td>
